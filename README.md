## Kyle Richardson - Portfolio

### Built with React

### Libraries used:

Material UI, iconify, fortawesome, react-typist

### Note about styling: 

I have used this codebase as not only an accurate portolio to showcase my projects, but also as a place to test different ideas for code, especially in terms of styling.

More specifically, I employ the following styling techniques within this code:

- Pure CSS3 (using "className='class-name'" syntax in JSX) 
- In-line styling (using "style={{property: 'value'}}" syntax in JSX)
- Pure JS adding classes to DOM elements ("document.getElementById('id-name').classList.add('class-name')" syntax)
- Material UI makeStyles (CSS in JS with hooks)
- Material UI withStyles (creates higher order components from Material UI base components)
- Material UI ThemeProvider (changes all instances of className/component nested within the ThemeProvider component)

I also have some styles at the top of some component files, and others contained in a styles.js file.

Because of the many different styling ideologies used, this may be difficult to fork and use yourself.  However, you are more than welcome to do so.
